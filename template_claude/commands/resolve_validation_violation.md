# Resolve Validation Violation

Fix a specific code validation violation by applying the minimal, targeted changes required to resolve the issue.

## Purpose

Automatically resolve code quality violations detected by the `/validate` command by:

- Analyzing the specific violation (rule, file, location, message)
- Understanding the context and current code structure
- Applying rule-specific fixes that maintain code quality standards
- Verifying the fix resolves the violation

## Arguments

This command expects a JSON violation object as an argument with the following structure:

```json
{
  "rule": "string",
  "file": "string",
  "line": number | null,
  "column": number | null,
  "severity": "error" | "warning",
  "message": "string",
  "fix_suggestion": "string" | null
}
```

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze the Violation

Parse the provided violation JSON to understand:
- **Rule**: Which code quality rule was violated
- **File**: The file containing the violation
- **Line/Column**: Exact location of the violation
- **Message**: Specific violation details
- **Fix Suggestion**: Guidance on how to fix (if available)

### 2. Context Discovery

Read the affected file to understand:
- Current code structure around the violation
- What packages/imports are being used incorrectly
- What the code is trying to accomplish

### 3. Determine Fix Strategy

Based on the rule violated, apply the appropriate fix.

{{COMMON_VIOLATIONS_GUIDE}}

<!--
Replace the section above with language-specific guidance for the most common
violations you expect, including:
- Static analysis violations (e.g., printf format mismatches, shadowed variables)
- Formatting violations (e.g., import grouping, line length)
- Linter violations (e.g., unchecked errors, unused variables, code simplification)
For each, show a "Before" and "After" example.
-->

### 4. Apply the Fix

Make the minimal necessary changes:
- Edit only the affected file(s)
- Keep changes focused on resolving the specific violation
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Maintain {{LANGUAGE}} idioms and patterns

### 5. Verify the Violation Is Resolved

After applying changes:
1. **CRITICAL**: Verify using `{{LINT_COMMAND}} <file>` to confirm the specific violation is resolved
2. Verify the specific violation no longer appears in the output
3. Check that no new validation violations were introduced

**SRP note:** This command's only job is to fix the one validation violation. Do **not** run the test suite here — that belongs to `/test`. Re-running `/validate` or `/test` is the next phase's responsibility.

**Verification command**:
```bash
{{LINT_COMMAND}} <file> 2>&1 | grep -i "<rule-name>"
# If no output, the violation is fixed
```

## Report Format

After fixing the violation, provide a concise report:

```markdown
### Violation Resolved

**Rule**: <rule-name>
**File**: <file-path>:<line>

**Changes Made**:
- <Brief description of what was changed>
- <Brief description of what was changed>

**Verification**:
- Re-ran validation: [PASS/FAIL]
- Violation resolved: [YES/NO]
- Tests passing: [YES/NO]
```

## Notes

- Focus on fixing ONE violation at a time
- Don't make changes beyond what's needed to fix the violation
- Follow {{LANGUAGE}} best practices and idioms
- **ALWAYS verify using `{{LINT_COMMAND}} <file>`** - never rely on a different formatter/linter for verification, as they may have different rules
- If the fix introduces new violations, adjust the approach
- Do **not** run the test suite here — `/test` is a separate pipeline phase
