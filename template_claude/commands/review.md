# Review

Follow the `Instructions` below to **review work done against a specification file** (specs/*.md) to ensure implemented features match requirements. Use the spec file to understand the requirements and use git diff to understand the changes made. If there are issues, report them; if not, report success.

## Variables

adw_id: $ARGUMENT
spec_file: $ARGUMENT
agent_name: $ARGUMENT if provided, otherwise use 'review_agent'

## Instructions

- Check current git branch using `git branch` to understand context
- Run `git diff origin/main` to see all changes made in current branch. Continue even if there are no changes related to the spec file.
- Find the spec file by looking for specs/*.md files in the diff that match the current branch name
- Read the identified spec file to understand requirements
- IMPORTANT: We're reviewing a {{LANGUAGE}} application implementation. Focus on:
  - Code correctness and adherence to spec
  - Proper error handling
  - Test coverage
  - Application behavior matches expectations
  - Proper {{LANGUAGE}} patterns and conventions
- IMPORTANT: Issue Severity Guidelines
  - Think hard about the impact of the issue on the feature and the user
  - Guidelines:
    - `skippable` - the issue is non-blocker for the work to be released but is still a problem
    - `tech_debt` - the issue is non-blocker for the work to be released but will create technical debt that should be addressed in the future
    - `blocker` - the issue is a blocker for the work to be released and should be addressed immediately. It will harm the user experience or will not function as expected.
- IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object with review results
  - IMPORTANT: Output your result in JSON format based on the `Report` section below.
  - IMPORTANT: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting
  - We'll immediately run JSON.parse() on the output, so make sure it's valid JSON
- Ultra think as you work through the review process. Focus on the critical functionality and code quality.

## Scope (SRP)

This command's only job is to compare the implementation against the spec and surface code-quality / correctness issues. It is one phase in a pipeline:

```
… ──► /validate ──► /test ──► /review ──► /document
```

By the time `/review` runs, `/validate` and `/test` have already executed. Do **not** re-run the build, static analysis, or the test suite here. If you need to know whether tests or validation passed, read the prior phase's output rather than re-running anything.

## Report

- IMPORTANT: Return results exclusively as a JSON object based on the `Output Structure` section below.
- `success` should be `true` if there are NO BLOCKING issues (implementation matches spec for critical functionality)
- `success` should be `false` ONLY if there are BLOCKING issues that prevent the work from being released
- `review_issues` can contain issues of any severity (skippable, tech_debt, or blocker)
- This allows subsequent agents to quickly identify and resolve blocking errors while documenting all issues

## Review Issues File

- If there are ANY issues found (regardless of severity), create a review issues file:
  - Create the directory `specs/review_issues/` if it doesn't exist
  - Create a file named `specs/review_issues/review-{adw_id}.md` where {adw_id} is the workflow ID
  - Use the Write tool to create this file with the following structure:
    ```markdown
    # Review Issues - {adw_id}

    **Spec File:** {spec_file}
    **Review Date:** {current_date}
    **Status:** {PASSED or FAILED based on success field}

    ## Summary

    {review_summary}

    ## Issues Found: {count}

    {For each issue, create a section like:}
    ### Issue #{review_issue_number}: {issue_severity}

    **File:** {file_path}

    **Description:**
    {issue_description}

    **Resolution:**
    {issue_resolution}

    ---
    ```
- If there are NO issues, do NOT create the review issues file

### Output Structure

```json
{
    "success": "boolean - true if there are NO BLOCKING issues (can have skippable/tech_debt issues), false if there are BLOCKING issues",
    "review_summary": "string - 2-4 sentences describing what was built and whether it matches the spec. Written as if reporting during a standup meeting.",
    "review_issues": [
        {
            "review_issue_number": "number - the issue number based on the index of this issue",
            "file_path": "string - path/to/file:line_number",
            "issue_description": "string - description of the issue",
            "issue_resolution": "string - description of the resolution",
            "issue_severity": "string - severity of the issue between 'skippable', 'tech_debt', 'blocker'"
        }
    ]
}
```
